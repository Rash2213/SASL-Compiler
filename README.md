## 📑 Documentation

We have added [issues](https://github.com/DBatUTuebingen-Teaching/sasl-ss25-bunten-bieber/issues) to this repository that act as a guide through the project and as a progress indicator. Documenting the work you do—both in these issues and in your code—is **mandatory**.

## ⚠ Teamwork

This is a **Team** Project, thus you need to work together. If you have any problems—be it that your team partner is slacking or that your team partner is "running ahead" in the project without you—please reach out to us!
